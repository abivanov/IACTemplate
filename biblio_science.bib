@article{Lustig2007,
abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

	abstract ={AbstractRemote sensing data provide essential input for today's climate and ecosystem models. It is generally agreed that many model processes are not accurately depicted by current remotely sensed indices of vegetation and that new observational capabilities are needed at different spatial and spectral scales to reduce uncertainty. Recent advances in materials and optics have allowed the development of smaller, more stable, accurately calibrated imaging spectrometers that can quantify biophysical properties on the basis of the spectral absorbing and scattering characteristics of the land surface. Airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers, which measure large numbers (hundreds) of narrow spectral bands, are becoming more widely available from government and commercial sources; thus, it is increasingly feasible to use data from imaging spectroscopy for environmental research. In contrast to multispectral sensors, imaging spectroscopy produces quantitative estimates of biophysical absorptions, which can be used to improve scientific understanding of ecosystem functioning and properties. We present the recent advances in imaging spectroscopy and new capabilities for using it to quantify a range of ecological variables.},

	abstract ={AbstractCharacterization of ecosystem structure, diversity, and function is increasingly desired at finer spatial and temporal scales than have been derived in the past. Many ecological applications require detailed data representing large spatial extents, but these data are often unavailable or are impractical to gather using field-based techniques. Remote sensing offers an option for collecting data that can represent broad spatial extents with detailed attribute characterizations. Remotely sensed data are also appropriate for use in studies across spatial scales, in conjunction with field-collected data. This article presents the pertinent technical aspects of remote sensing for images at high spatial resolution (i.e., with a pixel size of 16 square meters or less), existing and future options for the processing and analysis of remotely sensed data, and attributes that can be estimated with these data for forest ecosystems.},

	abstract ={The dynamics of pigment concentrations are diagnostic of a range of plant physiological properties and processes. This paper appraises the developing technologies and analytical methods for quantifying pigments non-destructively and repeatedly across a range of spatial scales using hyperspectral remote sensing. Progress in deriving predictive relationships between various characteristics and transforms of hyperspectral reflectance data are evaluated and the roles of leaf and canopy radiative transfer models are reviewed. Requirements are identified for more extensive intercomparisons of different approaches and for further work on the strategies for interpreting canopy scale data. The paper examines the prospects for extending research to the wider range of pigments in addition to chlorophyll, testing emerging methods of hyperspectral analysis and exploring the fusion of hyperspectral and LIDAR remote sensing. In spite of these opportunities for further development and the refinement of techniques, current evidence of an expanding range of applications in the ecophysiological, environmental, agricultural, and forestry sciences highlights the growing value of hyperspectral remote sensing of plant pigments.},

	year = {2011}, 
	doi = {10.1177/0309133311423172}, 
	abstract ={The ‘ecosystem service’ debate has taken on many features of a classic Kuhnian paradigm. It challenges conventional wisdoms about conservation and the value of nature, and is driven as much by political agendas as scientific ones. In this paper we review some current and emerging issues arising in relation to the analysis and assessment of ecosystem services, and in particular emphasize the need for physical geographers to find new ways of characterizing the structure and dynamics of service providing units. If robust and relevant valuations are to be made of the contribution that natural capital makes to human well-being, then we need a deeper understanding of the way in which the drivers of change impact on the marginal outputs of ecosystem services. A better understanding of the trade-offs that need to be considered when dealing with multifunctional ecosystems is also required. Future developments must include methods for describing and tracking the stocks and flows that characterize natural capital. This will support valuation of the benefits estimation of the level of reinvestment that society must make in this natural capital base if it is to be sustained. We argue that if the ecosystem service concept is to be used seriously as a framework for policy and management then the biophysical sciences generally, and physical geography in particular, must go beyond the uncritical ‘puzzle solving’ that characterizes recent work. A geographical perspective can provide important new, critical insights into the place-based approaches to ecosystem assessment that are now emerging.},

	abstract ={In the event of a natural disaster, remote sensing is a valuable source of spatial information and its utility has been proven on many occasions around the world. However, there are many different types of hazards experienced worldwide on an annual basis and their remote sensing solutions are equally varied. This paper addresses a number of data types and image processing techniques used to map and monitor earthquakes, faulting, volcanic activity, landslides, flooding, and wildfire, and the damages associated with each. Remote sensing is currently used operationally for some monitoring programs, though there are also difficulties associated with the rapid acquisition of data and provision of a robust product to emergency services as an end-user. The current status of remote sensing as a rapid-response data source is discussed, and some perspectives given on emerging airborne and satellite technologies.},
